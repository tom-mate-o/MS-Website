I won a poster award at NAC (Dutch Earth Science Conference)! It seems the [Visualize your Science](https://www.visualizeyourscience.com) course really paid off! Big thanks to all the course instructors and my peers for all their feedback and the amazing training, and to the organisers of NAC for a great conference and for awarding me the prize.

You can view the poster [here](./poster.pdf).
