I won a poster award at NAC (Dutch Earth Science Conference)! It seems the [Visualize your Science](https://www.visualizeyourscience.com) course really paid off!<!--truncate-->
Big thanks to all the course instructors and my peers for all their feedback and the amazing training, and to the organisers of NAC for a great conference and for awarding me the prize.

You can view the poster [here](./poster.pdf). You might recognise the layout from somewhere... ðŸ˜Š Thanks to [Tom Kra](https://tomkra.dev) for making an amazing website design inspired by this poster!
