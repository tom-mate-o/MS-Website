I recently submitted two new articles and they are both available as preprints via the ESS Open Archive.

The first is about [estimating eddy diffusivity from mooring data](https://essopenarchive.org/users/744129/articles/1357715-estimating-cross-stream-isopycnal-eddy-diffusivity-from-mooring-observations-in-the-southern-ocean?commit=ec9aba1e95565d6824caf11c30fb0477ed1d0f90), applied to a mooring in the Southern Ocean. We propose a new method to transform mooring time series to spatial data and derive eddy diffusivities from those data, using mixing length theory.

The second is about [eddy diffusivity over a topographic slope in a 2LQG model](https://essopenarchive.org/users/744129/articles/1361790-asymmetric-effects-of-topographic-slopes-on-lagrangian-and-eulerian-eddy-diffusivities-in-two-layer-qg-flow?commit=384d86b515e79279f1fb6d333b494b6989a3806f). We study eddy diffusivities using a Lagrangian particle tracking approach in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model with a varying topographic slope. Moreover, we compare these results with diffusivities derived from eddy PV fluxes.
