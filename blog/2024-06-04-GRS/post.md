This weekend I'll be travelling to the US to attend the Gordon Research [Seminar](https://www.grc.org/ocean-mixing-grs-conference/2024/) and [Conference](https://www.grc.org/ocean-mixing-conference/2024/) on Ocean Mixing. <!--truncate-->
Myself and [Josué Martínez Moreno](https://josuemtzmo.github.io/about.html?lang=en) are the chairs of the seminar, which is organised by and for early career researchers. For many months we've worked hard to put together an exciting programme, and I'm really looking forward to the seminar and conference finally happening!
