For the past year, I have worked together with some amazing people to organise the [Gordon Research Seminar](https://www.grc.org/ocean-mixing-grs-conference/2024/) and [Conference](https://www.grc.org/ocean-mixing-conference/2024/) on Ocean Mixing, which will take place in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in the coming week. We have worked hard to put together an engaging programme which will bring together the community of researchers working on any aspect of ocean mixing. Working on organising this event has been a very useful and fun experience. I am very excited to finally have the seminar and conference take place and look forward to meeting everyone.
