For the last few months I've been part of the organising Team of WomenNetPhysics, a networking conference to empower and connect women+ in the field of physics in the Netherlands. We put together a programme featuring two keynote talks from senior scientists, a panel discussion and scientific talks by PhD students from Utrecht University. Today the event took place and it has been a great success! As we intended, there was a lot of exchange between people from all career stages. We noted that there is a clear need to exchange experiences and advice, especially among students. We hope that we can continue WomenNetPhysics in some form in the future.
